# cliapp: General Purpose Go CLI App Template

This project is a template for building general purpose cross-platform Go CLI tools using Cobra, Docker, and modern automation. **No application binary or source is shipped in this repository**â€”instead, you get automation (Makefile, Docker, CI) to rapidly scaffold, build, and test your own CLI app.

## Features
- **Cobra-based CLI**: Standard Go CLI layout under `cmd/` (created by automation).
- **Docker & DevContainer**: Develop in a reproducible container with all tools preinstalled.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for build, test, lint, and CodeQL security scanning.
- **Makefile**: Common tasks automated (build, test, lint, format, clean, scaffold).
- **AI-Ready**: Optimized for use with GitHub Copilot and other AI tools.

## Quick Start

### 1. Scaffold and Build Your App
```bash
make newapp APPNAME=myapp   # Scaffold a new CLI app named 'myapp'
make build APPNAME=myapp    # Build the app (outputs to bin/myapp)
./bin/myapp --help          # Run your new CLI app
```

### 2. Add Your Commands
- Use `cobra-cli add <command>` to scaffold new commands in `cmd/` (after initial generation).
- Edit `cmd/root.go` to customize the app.

## Project Structure (after running `make newapp APPNAME=myapp` and `make build APPNAME=myapp`)
```
myapp/
  main.go
  cmd/
bin/
  myapp
```

> **Note:** The app source directory (e.g., `myapp/`) and binary (e.g., `bin/myapp`) are generated by automation and are not tracked in git. See `.gitignore`.

## CI/CD
- On push/PR: Build, test, lint (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- CodeQL security scan (see `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`).
